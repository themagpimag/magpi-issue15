Great mag, reminds me why I was drawn to Linux in the first place now that other mags are all fading.

Thank you very much for your amazing work ! It reminds me when I was using the ZX81 way back and reading the magazines we had in France then...

I've already connected the RaspberryPi to our TV set and my 8 years old son is having a blast creating Scratch sprites and having them move around and change colors when they hit each other.

I'm trying to teach him new tricks once in a while and I'm having some fun too !

splendid picture of the author (ladies, form an orderly queue), is the
southern pier of Ironbridge, nr Telford, the first, er, Iron Bridge.
